It can be very difficult to find resources to guide Bayesian modelling that are intelligible to a beginner. I have found the following to be quite helpful. 

In no particular order:

[Poisson regression in brms](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/lnc3.12439)

Winter, B., & Bürkner, P.-C. (2021). Poisson regression for linguists: A tutorial introduction to modelling count data with brms. Language and Linguistics Compass, 15(11), e12439. 

[Choosing weakly informative priors](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/oik.05985)

Lemoine, N. P. (2019). Moving beyond noninformative priors: Why and how to choose weakly informative priors in Bayesian analyses. Oikos, 128(7), 912–928.
